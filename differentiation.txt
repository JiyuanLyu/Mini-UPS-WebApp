Product Differentiation:

1. Searching Package for different account

For the requirement of the ability to enter a tracking number and see the status of the shipment,
we allow that the people who are not logged in can check the package status and delivery map by searching the corresponding package id. 
For the safety concern, we suggest to add the ability to confirm the zip code before showing the messages for the real world shipping website. 

For the user who are logged in, they can see their packages status, delivery map and product details by searching the package id or check the My Packages tab.
They can also search the packages that are not connect with a UPS user account, but they cannot see the product details. 
What's more, if they search some packages that are not belongs to their account. They cannot see any infomation but a reminder of this package does not belong to them. 

2. Delivery Map

Besides the status of the package delivery, we develop a function of displaying a delivery map of showing the warehouse location and the destination location. 
The graph of map (displaying  x and y axis) will adapt to the screen depends on the coordinates. 

3. Avoid hacking with URL

To prevent unlogged-in and unauthorized user to see the infomation via editing urls, we make sure that
    - only logged-in user can see their own packages
    - only logged-in user can edit their own packages' destinations
    - only logged-in user can see their account infomation
    - only logged-in user can see their product details
Example: User 1 and unlogged-in user cannot see the packages, edit destinations, check the account infomation and product details of User 2.
